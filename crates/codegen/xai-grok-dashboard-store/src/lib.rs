//! SQLite-backed persistent dashboard workspace: membership, layout ranks, and grouping.
//!
//! # Ownership contract
//!
//! This crate owns every byte of workspace-store SQL.
//! No other code may touch the database for this feature: consumers get the typed API and nothing else.
//! Every statement names its columns; decode indexes refer to that explicit projection, never table order.
//! Additive schema evolution therefore cannot clobber columns a binary does not know.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Every [`SessionId`] in the program is a validated single path component; ids joined into filesystem paths cannot traverse.
//! - `origin` is written once at insert; no API can rewrite it.
//! - Membership is capped at [`WORKSPACE_CAPACITY`].
//!   Inserting at capacity evicts the least-recently-changed unpinned members in the same transaction.
//!   When every member is pinned, the insert refuses with a typed error.
//! - Unknown enum text written by newer binaries round-trips byte-identical.
//!
//! # Consumer contracts
//!
//! - Own **one** [`WorkspaceStore`] per process and route every read and write through it.
//!   `data_version` only tells apart commits from other connections, so a second handle in the same process would look like a foreign writer.
//! - [`WorkspaceStore::open`] creates the directory and file.
//!   Callers that must not create the store (e.g. while the feature is disabled) must not call it.
//! - A corrupt or newer-schema file is never deleted, truncated, or quarantined.
//!   The typed errors ([`StoreError::Unusable`], [`StoreError::NewerSchema`]) leave recovery to the user.
