3. Files and Code Sections: Every file examined, created, or modified. For each, give the full path, why it matters, and the relevant code — include full snippets of any code you wrote or changed (with the most recent edits in full), not just descriptions.
4. Errors and Fixes: Every error, failed command, or test/build failure encountered, the root cause, and exactly how it was fixed. Note any fix that came from user feedback verbatim.
5. Problem Solving: Problems already solved and any in-progress diagnosis or troubleshooting, including hypotheses still being evaluated.
6. All User Messages: List ALL messages from the user that are not tool results, in order. These are critical for understanding intent and how it evolved. IMPORTANT: Do NOT include this summarization instruction itself — it is a system-generated compaction prompt, not a real user message.
7. Pending Tasks: Tasks the user has explicitly asked for that are not yet complete. Do not invent tasks the user never requested.
8. Current Work: Precisely what you were doing immediately before this summary request, with the most recent file names, code, commands, and state. Be specific enough that work can resume mid-stream.
9. Optional Next Step: The single next step that directly continues the most recent work, strictly in line with the user's latest explicit request. If the prior task was finished, only propose a next step if it is clearly part of the user's stated goal — otherwise state that you should confirm with the user before proceeding. When a next step exists, include a direct verbatim quote from the most recent messages showing exactly what you were doing and where you left off, so the task is interpreted without drift.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT call or use any tools. Respond with ONLY the <summary>...</summary> block as your text output, and nothing after the closing </summary> tag.
