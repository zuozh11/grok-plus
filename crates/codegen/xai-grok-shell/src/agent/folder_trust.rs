//! Folder-trust gate ("do you trust this folder?").
//!
//! Repo-local MCP / LSP servers and permission policy are configured by files an attacker can ship inside a cloned repository.
//! Those files include `.mcp.json`, project `.grok/config.toml` (`[permission]` / `[mcp_servers]` / `[plugins].paths`), and `.grok/lsp.json`.
//! `~/.claude.json` `projects.<cwd>` is another such source.
//! Those configs contain commands or auto-approve rules the CLI would otherwise honor automatically, a 1-click RCE / policy bypass.
//! This module resolves a VS-Code-style trust decision ONCE per workspace, BEFORE any repo-local server is spawned.
//! It exposes a cheap [`project_scope_allowed`] check that the MCP/LSP/permission loaders consult.
//!
//! Resolution lives here (not in `acp_session`) so the session core stays free of feature logic.
//! The loaders only call [`project_scope_allowed`].
//!
//! The DECISION side lives in `xai-grok-workspace` (client-side).
//! It holds the workspace scan, the pure [`decide`] precedence, and the interactive prompt.
//! It also owns the durable [`xai_grok_workspace::trust::TrustStore`] reads/writes.
//! This module keeps the CONSUME/gating side: the `DECISIONS` cache, [`resolve_and_record`], and the loader filters.
//! The ordered trust precedence is documented canonically on [`xai_grok_workspace::folder_trust::decide`].
//! The consume-side nuance is that two allows are PROVISIONAL (NOT cached).
//! The first is the "no repo configs" allow.
//! Configs appearing after the first resolve (git pull / agent write) are re-checked on the next resolve rather than riding a stale grant.
//! The second is the unrecordable-key allow (cwd is $HOME / fs-root), which can never be persisted (see [`resolve_and_record_inner`] / [`compute`]).
