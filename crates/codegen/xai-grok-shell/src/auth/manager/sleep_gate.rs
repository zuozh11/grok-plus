//! Keeps an [`AuthManager`] token refresh from straddling a system sleep.
//!
//! A refresh that straddles a suspend can lose its rotated successor token, leaving a revoked refresh token on disk and forcing re-login.
//! Two layers guard against that straddle:
//!
//! 1. The gate `refresh_chain` consults *defers* a refresh that has not started yet.
//!    An in-flight refresh is never aborted: dropping it could discard a response carrying the rotated token, the very revocation we guard against.
//!    See [`AuthManager::refresh_chain`].
//! 2. When sleep becomes imminent while a refresh is in flight, [`AuthManager::set_system_sleep_imminent`] **holds the OS sleep acknowledgment**.
//!    The hold lasts until the refresh drains or [`SLEEP_ACK_MAX_WAIT`] elapses, so the exchange finishes *before* the machine suspends.
//!    macOS delays `IOAllowPowerChange` and Linux holds its `delay` inhibitor, both via the blocking power-listener callback.
//!
//! Split out of `manager.rs` so the manager stays scannable.
//! It is self-contained: the [`SleepGate`] type, the [`InFlightGuard`], and a small `impl AuthManager` block driving them from OS power events.
