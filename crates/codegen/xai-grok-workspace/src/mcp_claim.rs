//! Which tool ids a session's MCP servers may advertise.
//!
//! Pure planning, kept apart from the bridge lifecycle in `mcp.rs` so the
//! rules are testable without a hub or live transports. Invariants:
//!
//! - a native tool id is never claimed by any MCP server;
//! - a first-party server (an endpoint the bind config designated with
//!   [`BindMcpConfig::with_first_party_servers`]) outranks every third-party
//!   server for an id, exactly as natives outrank MCP — a user-configured
//!   server can therefore never remove an app-defined tool by offering the
//!   same name;
//! - within one tier an id offered by two servers is ambiguous and nobody
//!   claims it, rather than letting start order decide;
//! - the per-session cap is spent first-party first, so a third-party
//!   server's tool count can never starve the app's tools.
//!
//! The first-party rule is the one way an id can change owner while staying
//! claimed: a first-party server that starts after a third-party sibling
//! already advertised the id takes it over. The hub reconciler
//! (`mcp::reconcile_session_tools`) therefore diffs owners, not just the
//! owned set, because the hub's same-life re-register is a no-op that would
//! otherwise keep the sibling's handler.
//!
