//! Filesystem helpers backing the client-facing `workspace.client_fs_*` RPCs.
//! The grok.com conversation-files UI and the chat backend call them, tunneled through the server.
//!
//! Deliberately separate from the shell-facing ext ops in [`ext_fs`](super::ext_fs).
//! Every path is relative to the client-fs base (`WorkspaceHandle::client_fs_base`) and resolves through the root-confinement helper.
//! The list walk excludes symlinks that resolve outside the base and never descends into them.
//! Listings paginate with stable post-sort slices, and reads are binary-safe (base64 chunks).
//! Writes stage base64 chunks in a temp file beside the target and rename it into place on finalize; the target and `overwrite` are pinned by the first chunk.
//!
//! Wire types live in `xai_grok_workspace_types::rpc::fs` (the `ClientFs*` types), shared with the backend caller.
