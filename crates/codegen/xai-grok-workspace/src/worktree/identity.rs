//! Path-derived identity of a grok-managed worktree.
//!
//! Every creation path resolves its destination to `<grok home>/worktrees/<repo slug>/<label>`, with the label as the last path component.
//! A session cwd anywhere inside a worktree is therefore enough to recover the label.
//! The worktree DB only enriches the result with the recorded source repo.
//! It is a cache, never a dependency, so identity can be stamped on summaries even when the DB is missing or empty.
