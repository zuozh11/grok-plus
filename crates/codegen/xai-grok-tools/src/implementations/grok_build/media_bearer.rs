//! The one bearer decision the Imagine image and video clients share.
//!
//! Direct calls to `api.x.ai` carry exactly one of: the per-request bearer an `ApiKeyProvider`
//! resolves, or the static key the host configured. A provider outranks the static key, its
//! typed refusal is final, and with neither source the request is refused rather than sent
//! unauthenticated. Nothing is baked into a client's default headers, so a host cannot leak a
//! token by configuring the client with the wrong one.
