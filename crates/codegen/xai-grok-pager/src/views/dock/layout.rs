//! Row layout for the dock.
//!
//! The dock is a fixed strip above the prompt, so it holds two invariants that
//! the rest of the widget relies on:
//!
//! - It never asks for more rows than [`DockCounts::max_rows`], or the 2-row
//!   floor (plus a queue-body row) when that floor is taller.
//! - Every non-empty section keeps its header row. Sections give up rows before
//!   a header does, and a section that cannot show every row spends its last one
//!   on a `show N more` line and scrolls inside the band it was granted.
