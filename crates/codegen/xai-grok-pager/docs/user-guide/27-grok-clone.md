# grok clone

`grok clone` fetches a Git repository into a Grove content store and mounts a
projected working tree (NFS on macOS, FUSE on Linux). Each invocation reads
`GROK_CLONE` / `GROVE_CLONE` in this process, then grok enable-all
(`GROK_GROVE` or `[cli] grove` in `~/.grok/config.toml`), then `[clone] enabled`
authorize Clone IPC.

This does **not** enable Grove for session / `-w` worktrees. Those use a
separate gate (`GROK_WORKTREE_TYPE` and `[cli] grove_worktree` in
`~/.grok/config.toml`; see [Configuration reference](26-config-reference.md)).
`GROK_WORKTREE_TYPE` and `[cli] grove_worktree` do **not** enable `grok clone`.
`GROK_CLONE` / `GROVE_CLONE` / `[clone] enabled` do **not** enable session /
`-w` Grove.

To turn **both** surfaces on without touching the specific knobs:

```bash
export GROK_GROVE=1
# or in ~/.grok/config.toml:
# [cli]
# grove = true
```

Specific knobs still win: `GROK_WORKTREE_TYPE=copy` keeps session worktrees on
copy while clone can stay on; `GROK_CLONE=0` keeps `grok clone` off while
worktrees can stay on.

```bash
grok clone <url> [dir] [--branch NAME] [--full-history]
```

## History

**Default is a depth-1 bootstrap** of the selected branch (`blob:none` +
`--depth=1`). Only that branch is advertised as a remote-tracking ref.

Use `--full-history` when you need complete commit history, tags, or every
remote branch at clone time (the previous default).

After a depth-1 clone, these commands deepen **only the selected branch**:

```bash
git fetch --deepen=N origin
git fetch --unshallow origin
```

Fetching another branch needs an explicit depth-limited refspec. An ordinary
`git fetch origin` or `git fetch origin other` will not pull that branch's
full history through the default refspec:

```bash
git fetch --depth=1 origin refs/heads/NAME:refs/remotes/origin/NAME
```

`clone_shallow` RPC. If the client refuses, restart or update the daemon (or
pass `--full-history`):

```bash
```

On macOS you can also install a KeepAlive agent:

```bash
```

## Authentication

The two are separate worlds:

| World | Covers | Commands | Store |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Grok | the model and API | `grok login`, `grok logout` | `~/.grok/auth.json` |

`grok clone` never reads `~/.grok/auth.json` for Git. Signing into Grok does not
give the daemon a credential for the remote, and neither does
`[clone] enabled = true`: that flag is a **product gate** deciding whether
`grok clone` runs at all, not authorization for GitHub.

When Grove classifies a failure as a credential problem, the clone prints the
class and the commands that own it, without the remote URL:

```
Grove Git credentials rejected (unavailable).
Check `grove status` then `grove reload-credentials`.
```

| Class | Meaning | Next step |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `unavailable` | the daemon had no usable credential, or the remote rejected it | `grove status` names the live provider; fix that source, then `grove reload-credentials` |
| `expired-static` | the token expired and this deployment does not refresh tokens | start a new session, or enable `GROVE_TOKEN_ROTATION=expected` |
| `carrier-stale` | the daemon waited for a carrier rewrite and still holds the rejected token | wait for the rewrite, or `grove reload-credentials` |
| `other` | the credential provider failed for another reason | `grove status`, then `grove reload-credentials` |

Only `expired-static` and `carrier-stale` add their own line to the message. The
advice for `unavailable` depends on which provider the daemon holds, and the

One credential rejection stays unclassified: when a token cannot see a private
repository, GitHub answers as if the repository did not exist. That is
indistinguishable from a typo in a public URL, so the clone reports it as a
missing repository rather than guessing at credentials.

`grove status` prints a daemon-scoped auth block even with no mounts:

```
  auth: mode=auto live=git-delegate health=ok last=- reload=supported
        hint=credentials look healthy
```

`mode` is the configured `auth_mode`; `live` is the provider the daemon actually
holds. `mode` and `live` can disagree — that is the case
`grove reload-credentials` exists to fix. For example, with `auth_mode = auto`,
a daemon that started before a token file was written stays on `git-delegate`
until the cell is rebuilt.

```bash
grove reload-credentials
# grove: credentials reloaded → token-file
```

Reload rebuilds the cell from env and disk and prints the provider it landed on;
it prints no secrets. It cannot create a login: with `auto` or `git` and no
carrier token, configure `git credential` or `gh auth` first, then reload.

`auth.degraded`, `auth.unavailable`, `auth.daemon-down`, or `auth.old-daemon`.

## Daemon

`grok` does not take the daemon or its mounts down) and waits for the socket.

The `grove` binary is resolved from `PATH`, then from the directory of the
`grok` executable (for example `~/.grok/bin/grove` next to `grok`). There is
no separate install location. macOS has no PATH package for grove; build it
from the monorepo:

```bash
cargo build -p grove --release
```

On Linux, clone needs a usable FUSE before it starts a daemon: `/dev/fuse` must
exist, and either this user can open it or a setuid `fusermount3` / `fusermount`
error with install commands, not a hang. When a daemon is already running the
check is skipped, since that daemon may hold privileges this process does not.

On Windows, clone mounts through ProjFS (Windows Projected File System),
whether it is enabled. Build-output directories such as `target` and
`node_modules` are redirected out of the projected tree as NTFS junctions
(`[redirects] windows_junction`, on by default).
