# Cross-Session Memory

Memory lets Grok recall facts, decisions, and patterns from earlier sessions. Grok indexes the information you save and searches it automatically, so a new session can reuse relevant context.

---

## What Is Memory?

Without memory, each Grok session starts fresh: the model knows nothing about previous sessions. When you enable memory, Grok can:

- Recall project conventions you explained before.
- Reuse debugging steps that worked.
- Carry architectural decisions forward across sessions.
- Avoid re-asking questions it already has answers to.

Memory is experimental and disabled by default.

### How memory is organized

Memory has two scopes. Global memory holds facts that apply across all your
projects; workspace memory holds facts about one repository. Clones and
worktrees of the same repository share one workspace scope.

Each scope keeps its knowledge as ordinary Markdown files. `topics/` holds
curated notes, one file per subject, and is what Grok reads at the start of a
session. New facts captured from a completed turn land as small observations
that a later consolidation pass (`/dream`) folds into topics. A bounded generated
index of both scopes is injected into the model's context once per session so
it can decide which topics to open.

Notes you recorded with earlier versions of Grok Build are carried over
automatically the first time a workspace is opened after updating: each section
of the earlier notes becomes a topic, and sections whose name already matches a
topic are appended to it under a "From earlier sessions" heading. The earlier
files are left in place unchanged.

Memory product telemetry contains only fixed enums, booleans, counts, and
durations. It never includes prompts, statements, topic names, keywords,
paths, model output, or free-form errors.

## Enabling Memory

### Config (Persistent)

```toml
# ~/.grok/config.toml
[memory]
enabled = true
```

### Environment Variable

```bash
export GROK_MEMORY=1
grok
```

### Force-Disable

To disable memory for the process even when TOML or remote settings enable it:

```bash
export GROK_MEMORY=0
```

### Mid-Session Toggle

Toggle memory on or off during a session without restarting: open `/memory`
and press `t`.

The toggle is session-scoped -- it does not persist to `config.toml`, and it works in both directions: a session that started with `[memory] enabled = true` can turn memory off, and a session that started with `[memory] enabled = false` can turn it on. New sessions follow `config.toml` again. Toggling off removes access to memory tools and the memory instructions in the system prompt but keeps existing files on disk. Toggling on re-initializes memory storage, registers the memory tools, restores the memory instructions, and injects the memory index on the next turn. Turning memory on waits for any turn in progress to finish.

The toggle cannot override the process-wide force-disable (`--no-memory` or `GROK_MEMORY=0`); those hide `/memory` for the whole session.

### Priority Order

1. A process-wide force-disable (`--no-memory` compatibility flag or
   `GROK_MEMORY=0`) turns memory off.
2. An explicit `[memory] enabled = false` in effective TOML turns memory off,
   including anything enabled by managed remote settings. The `/memory` `t`
   toggle can still turn it on for the current session.
3. Otherwise memory is enabled by `GROK_MEMORY=1`, `[memory] enabled = true`,
   or a managed remote setting.

Staged-rollout and kill-switch controls for operators are documented in the
internal hardening notes, not here.

## How Memory Is Stored

Memory is stored as Markdown files under `~/.grok/memory/`:

| Location | Scope | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md` | Global | Facts that apply across all your projects |
| `~/.grok/memory/<project-slug>-<hash8>/MEMORY.md` | Workspace | Project-specific conventions and context |
| `~/.grok/memory/<project-slug>-<hash8>/sessions/` | Sessions | Per-session summaries and logs |

Grok suffixes each workspace directory with a short hash of the repository's identity. The identity is the `origin` remote in `org/repo` form when the directory is a Git repository with an `origin` remote, or the directory path otherwise. Because clones and worktrees of the same repository share an `origin` remote, they also share one memory directory.

An SQLite index supports search across all memory files:
- **FTS5** provides the default full-text search for keyword matching.
- **vec0** adds vector search for semantic similarity when an embedding model is configured.

---

## Automatic Saves

When a session ends, Grok saves a structured metadata summary to that session's daily log. The summary contains:

- Message counts (user, assistant, and tool results).
- Topics: the first few substantive user prompts from the session, up to five.
- The session date and time (UTC).

Grok builds the summary from conversation metadata without an LLM call, without added latency. Grok skips the save for trivial sessions -- those with fewer than three substantive prompts, or fewer than 50 bytes of user text.

The summary does not record tool usage, file paths, or shell commands. The session ID forms part of the log filename. To turn automatic saves off, set `session.save_on_end = false`. For richer capture of decisions, patterns, and reasoning, use `/flush`.

---

## Saving Rich Knowledge with /flush

For richer capture -- decisions, patterns, debugging workflows, API discoveries -- use `/flush` in the TUI:

```
/flush
```

This triggers an LLM-generated summary of the current session's most important content and writes it to a dated session log. The summary is indexed and searchable in future sessions.

Use `/flush` when you want to preserve important context:
- Before compaction (which discards old conversation turns)
- At the end of a productive debugging session
- After discovering important patterns or conventions

---

## Working with Memory

### Remember

Ask Grok to remember something, and it appends the note to a `MEMORY.md` file -- the workspace file for project-specific items, or the global `~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md` for cross-project preferences:

```
> remember to always open PR links after pushing
```

Grok records entries as durable statements under organized headings, such as `## Preferences`, `## Project Context`, or `## Debugging`. The file watcher reindexes the change on the next memory search, so the new entry is searchable within the current session.

You can also save a note directly with the `/remember` command:

```
/remember always open PR links after pushing
```

Run `/remember` with no text to enter remember mode, where the next line you type becomes the note. Either way, Grok opens a review panel showing the note (with an optional rewritten version you can toggle with `Tab`); the note is written only after you confirm. On save, Grok shows `Memory saved to ~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md`.

### Forget

Ask Grok to forget something, and it finds and removes the matching entry:

```
> forget the snake_case convention
```

Forget is best-effort: the model searches memory and removes entries that match. For guaranteed removal, edit the files under `~/.grok/memory/` directly and delete the entry yourself. To locate a file, open the `/memory` browser and press `y` to copy its path.

### Recall

Ask what Grok remembers:

```
> what do you remember?
```

Grok searches across all memory files and summarizes what it knows, grouped by source: global preferences, project-specific knowledge, and session history. Use `/memory` to browse the raw files.

### Direct Editing

You can edit memory files directly under `~/.grok/memory/`. The file watcher reindexes your changes on the next memory search. Use `/flush` to save the current session now, and `/dream` to consolidate session logs into organized topics.

---

## Browsing Memory with /memory

The `/memory` command opens a modal showing all memory files:

```
/memory
```

Files are grouped by scope:
- **Global** -- cross-project memory (`MEMORY.md`).
- **Workspace** -- project-specific memory (`MEMORY.md`).
- **Sessions** -- per-session summaries, in reverse chronological order.

The modal uses a split-pane layout: the file list on the left, a read-only content preview on the right. The preview updates as you move through the list.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` | Move through the file list |
| `PgUp`/`PgDn` | Jump 10 entries |
| `/` | Filter the file list |
| `Enter` | Read the selected note: the preview takes keyboard focus (arrows, `PgUp`/`PgDn`, `Home`/`End` scroll it) |
| `y` | Copy the selected file's path to the clipboard |
| `x` | Delete the selected note (press `x` again to confirm) |
| `t` | Toggle memory on or off |
| `Ctrl+F` | Toggle fullscreen |
| `Esc` | Close the modal, or leave filter or preview focus |

The filter matches note names and note contents; separate words all have to match. When you filter, the preview scrolls to the first match. If nothing matches, the list says so; `Backspace` clears the filter.

The preview pane is read-only. Scroll it with the mouse wheel, by dragging its scrollbar, or with the keyboard after `Enter`. Drag across the preview text to copy that text to the clipboard; a brief message under the file list confirms every copy. Generated `MEMORY.md` indexes cannot be deleted.

When the memory modal's content area is under 64 columns, the modal shows the file list only and hides the size column; press `Enter` to read the selected note full-width and `Esc` to return to the list.

You can also open `/memory` from the command palette.

---

## Memory Notifications

When you save a note with `/remember`, Grok confirms in the scrollback:

```
Memory saved to ~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md
```

Background saves — automatic flush, automatic Dream, and session-end — run silently and do not post a scrollback message. `/flush` and `/dream` report their outcome in scrollback when you run them yourself. Use `/memory` at any time to browse what Grok has stored.

---

## Dream Consolidation with /dream

The `/dream` command consolidates scattered memory fragments into organized topics:

```
/dream
```

Dream reorganizes individual session logs and memory entries into a coherent, deduplicated knowledge base, which reduces noise and improves search quality over time. `/dream` requires memory to be enabled.

### Auto-Dream

Dream also runs automatically. By default, Grok checks the consolidation gates at launch and periodically during a session, and runs Dream once enough time has passed and enough sessions have accumulated:

```toml
[memory.dream]
enabled = true     # Run automatic consolidation (default: true)
min_hours = 24     # Minimum hours between consolidations
min_sessions = 5   # Minimum sessions since the last consolidation
check_interval_secs = 3600 # Also check the gates hourly
```

---

## How Memory Affects Prompts

### First-Turn Injection

On the first turn of each session, Grok automatically searches memory for content relevant to the current project and injects it as context. This means Grok starts with knowledge from previous sessions without a reminder.

First-turn injection can be configured:

```toml
[memory.initial_injection]
enabled = true     # Enable or disable first-turn injection
min_score = 0.9    # Score threshold for first-turn injection
```

### After Compaction

Memory is also searched after auto-compaction to recover relevant context that may have been discarded.

---

## Memory Search

Grok searches memory automatically, but you can also trigger searches manually in the chat:

```
Search memory for "auth middleware patterns"
Read my workspace MEMORY.md
```

The model has access to two memory tools:
- `memory_search` -- Search across all memory
- `memory_get` -- Read a specific memory file by path

### Search Scoring

The default embedding model is unset, so memory starts in full-text-only mode. If you configure an embedding model, search combines vector similarity (weight `0.7`) with BM25 text similarity (weight `0.3`). Results are filtered by a minimum score threshold (default: `0.7`).

### Source Weights

Each memory source has a weight multiplier applied to its score. All sources default to `1.0`, and you can adjust any of them under `[memory.search.source_weights]`:

| Source | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `workspace` | 1.0 | Project-specific memory |
| `session` | 1.0 | Session logs |
| `global` | 1.0 | Cross-project memory |

### Temporal Decay

Session memories decay over time so recent sessions are prioritized:

```toml
[memory.search.temporal_decay]
enabled = true           # Enable time-based decay
half_life_days = 30.0    # Score halves after this many days
```

Only session chunks decay. Global and workspace memories are exempt since they contain curated long-term knowledge.

### MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)

MMR re-ranking penalizes redundant results to improve diversity:

```toml
[memory.search.mmr]
enabled = true           # Enable diversity re-ranking
lambda = 0.7             # 0.0 = max diversity, 1.0 = pure relevance
```

---

## CLI Commands

The `grok memory` command manages memory from the shell. It has one subcommand, `clear`:

```bash
# Clear workspace memory (MEMORY.md, sessions/, and index.sqlite). This is the default scope.
grok memory clear

# The same scope, stated explicitly
grok memory clear --workspace

# Clear the global MEMORY.md
grok memory clear --global

# Clear both workspace and global memory
grok memory clear --all

# Skip the confirmation prompt (-y is the short form)
grok memory clear --yes
```

To edit memory from the shell, open the files in your editor directly -- for example, `$EDITOR ~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md`.

---

## Memory Staleness

When a session memory is old, Grok attaches a staleness note to it in search results. Older results get a stronger reminder to verify the current state before you rely on them. These notes help you spot stored facts that might no longer be accurate. Global and workspace memories never receive staleness notes, because they hold curated long-term knowledge.

---

## File Watcher

By default, Grok watches `~/.grok/memory/` for external file changes. If you edit memory files directly (e.g., in your editor), the changes are picked up automatically on the next memory search:

- Created or modified files are reindexed.
- Deleted files have their stale chunks removed from the index.

```toml
[memory.watcher]
enabled = true    # default
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Memory Not Working

1. Verify memory is enabled: check `grok inspect` output.
2. Check `GROK_MEMORY` or `[memory] enabled` in effective TOML.
3. Check for `GROK_MEMORY=0` or a deprecated compatibility flag overriding config.

### Memory Not Appearing in Sessions

Memory is injected on the first turn. If you started a session before enabling memory, start a new session with `/new`.

### Viewing Memory Files

Use `/memory` in the TUI to browse all memory files with a preview. You can also access them directly:

```bash
ls ~/.grok/memory/
cat ~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md
$EDITOR ~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md
```

### Debug Logging

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug GROK_LOG_FILE=/tmp/grok.log grok
grep "memory" /tmp/grok.log
```
