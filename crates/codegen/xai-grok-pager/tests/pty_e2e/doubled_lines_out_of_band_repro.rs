//! Doubled-lines regression guard via a simulated out-of-band screen reflow.
//!
//! The stack is `tmux -> nvim :terminal -> grok`: nvim/tmux repaint grok's pane out-of-band (no grok PTY resize).
//! Grok's diff renderer only re-clears on a real size change, so the rows it doesn't own survive.
//! You get doubled lines at the top/bottom until restart.
//!
//! The harness is a single faithful emulator and can't nest a real tmux/nvim.
//! We SIMULATE the out-of-band reflow with `feed_screen`, which writes straight into the virtual terminal, bypassing grok.
//! Then we check whether grok heals it.
//! `NVIM` is set in grok's env so it sees the embedded-editor context the fix keys off (mirroring a real nvim `:terminal`).
//!
//! The fix: grok forces a full clear and repaint on `FocusGained` in editor/multiplexer contexts, so the injected row is gone after refocus.
//! The final assertion guards that heal.
