//! Polls each `Ready` client for a closed transport.
//!
//! Each successful handshake spawns one [`TransportLivenessHandle`].
//! It polls the owning [`McpClient`]'s state machine on a small interval (default 500 ms).
//! On the **first observation of `Ready` with `is_transport_closed() == true`** it emits a single [`McpClientEvent::TransportClosed`] and exits.
//!
//! The poller is *one-shot*.
//! The session-side dispatcher decides what to do with the event.
//! It drops the dead client, reports `unavailable` over ACP, and triggers a restart on a debounce.
//!
//! ## Watcher state machine
//!
//! Per-tick classification (single state-mutex acquisition via [`McpClient::liveness_check`]):
//!
//! | State observed                | Action            | Emit?                  |
//! |-------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
//! | `Ready` + transport open      | continue polling  | no                     |
//! | `Ready` + transport closed    | clear slot, exit  | `TransportClosed`      |
//! | `Initializing` (re-handshake) | clear slot, exit  | no — silent withdrawal |
//! | `Pending`                     | clear slot, exit  | no — silent withdrawal |
//! | `Empty`                       | clear slot, exit  | no — silent withdrawal |
//!
//! This avoids a false-positive `TransportClosed` when someone calls `reset_transport()` or any other code path moves the state away from `Ready`.
//!
//! ## Slot-clearing on exit
//!
//! Before exiting, the task clears [`McpClient::liveness_handle`].
//! A subsequent [`McpClient::arm_liveness_watcher`] call can then install a fresh handle.
//! Without this, a dead [`TransportLivenessHandle`] left in the slot would silently block re-arming.
//!
//! ## Cancellation
//!
//! Dropping the [`TransportLivenessHandle`] cancels the spawned task via [`tokio_util::sync::DropGuard`].
//! Both teardown paths (the task clearing its own slot, an external drop) end by dropping the handle the same way.
//!
//! ## Why polling, not a `JoinHandle`-on-the-service-loop?
//!
//! rmcp 2.1's `RunningService` does not expose a future that resolves on transport shutdown.
//! The closest signal is `Peer::is_transport_closed()` (a state inspection), which is the same one [`McpClient::is_healthy`] reads.
//! A `select!` on a per-client `Notify` would require patching rmcp.
//! Polling avoids that quarantine break, and the overhead is negligible (one mutex acquire and one atomic load per tick).
