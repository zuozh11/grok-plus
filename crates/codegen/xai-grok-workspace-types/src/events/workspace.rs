//! Workspace-scoped events (FS changes, server lifecycle, discovery, ...).
//!
//! `WorkspaceEvent` carries only **workspace-observed external state**.
//! Examples: filesystem watcher fires, background subprocess (LSP / MCP) lifecycle, background indexing progress, config changes detected on disk.
//!
//! Sampler-caused state never goes here.
//! Hunk events (`HunkRecorded`, `HunkAccepted`, `HunkRejected`) are deliberately absent.
//! Hunks come from tool writes and `act_on_hunk` RPCs, both sampler-caused, so the sampler already has that state from the originating call.
//! It can re-snapshot via `list_hunks()` if it needs to reconcile.
//!
//! `ToolsChanged` is included on this enum because the tool registry is a workspace state observation.
//! An MCP server snapshot change (workspace-observed) and a sampler-initiated `update_tool_config` produce the same downstream effect.
//! Either way, other subscribers and the sampler's UI need to re-fetch `tool_definitions`.
//! Tool execution itself is **not** broadcast here; it stays on the sampler-caused tool-result path.
