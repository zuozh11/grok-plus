/// Kill-and-reap-on-drop ownership of a `std::process::Child`.
///
/// RAII floor for children whose owner normally ends them explicitly (test
/// fixtures, batch helpers): an early return or assertion panic between spawn
/// and the explicit kill must not leak the process. On Unix `Child::kill` is
/// SIGKILL, so the guard also ends children that trap SIGTERM. Shared form
/// of the kill-on-drop guards previously duplicated across test fixtures
/// and helpers.
///
/// Access the child through `Deref`/`DerefMut`; after reaping it by other
/// means (e.g. a clean `try_wait`), call [`Self::into_inner`] to disarm.
///
/// Dropping the guard after an in-handle `wait`/`try_wait` reap is also
/// safe: `std::process::Child` caches the exit status, so the drop's
/// `kill()` refuses to signal an already-waited child (no recycled-PID
/// signal) and its `wait()` returns the cached status. `into_inner` just
/// skips those no-op syscall attempts.
