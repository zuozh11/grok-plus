//! Server-side session event emitter.
//!
//! [`ObservabilityBridge`] is a thin facade for emitting session-level
//! events (turn lifecycle, phase changes) to the connected server. Tool-call events
//! (`ToolCallStarted` / `ToolCallCompleted`) are emitted automatically
//! by [`crate::harness::ToolHarness::call`] and do not need the bridge.
//!
//! The caller is responsible for also emitting to the local sink
//! (`EventTracker` in the shell, `EventProcPublisher` in the
//! chat service) — the bridge handles only the server leg.
//!
//! This separation is deliberate: each sampler's local sink has a
//! different type and API surface.  Forcing a trait/callback into the
//! bridge would add abstraction overhead without benefit, since the
//! call sites already have the local sink in scope.
